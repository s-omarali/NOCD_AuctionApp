# NOCD_AuctionApp

The Project: Bidding App (like eBay)
Build a basic bidding platform where users can:
1. Create listings with a title, description, starting price, end time, and optional image
2. Place bids on active listings — the highest bid should always win
3. See current highest bid and bidding history
4. Get notified (via text reminder) 
  4a. Seller gets notified on every new bid
  4b. Bidder gets notified when the get outbid or win
5. Ability to upload an image and auto generate a listing

You’re also free to add any extra features you think would make sense or be cool in an auction-style app!

Required Tech Stack
Python + Flask
MySQL
AWS (free tier is fine)
Retool
Gemini API (free tier — can be used for any helpful AI features)
Feel free to use any Python packages or AWS tools to support the build.

Important: All reads/writes should go through your API — no direct MySQL connections from Retool.
